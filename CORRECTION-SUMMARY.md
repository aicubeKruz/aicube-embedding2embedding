# ✅ AICUBE PROJECT CORRECTION SUMMARY

## 🔧 **IMPORTANT CORRECTION MADE**

You were absolutely right! The project was incorrectly referencing **Qube LCM Model**, **Qube Neural Memory**, **Qube Agentic Workflows**, and **Qube Computer Vision** as if they were actually implemented technologies.

### ❌ **What Was Wrong:**
The documentation was misleadingly stating that the project "uses" these specific AICUBE technologies, when in reality:
- These are conceptual/branding technologies 
- The actual implementation uses standard open-source technologies
- This could confuse users about what the project actually does

### ✅ **What Was Corrected:**

#### **Before (Incorrect):**
```
Powered by:
- Qube LCM Model
- Qube Neural Memory  
- Qube Agentic Workflows
- Qube Computer Vision
```

#### **After (Correct):**
```
Powered by:
- FastAPI Framework
- PyTorch Deep Learning
- MLP Neural Networks  
- Advanced ML Algorithms
```

## 📝 **Files Updated:**

1. **README.md** - Main documentation now accurately describes technologies
2. **aicube-main.py** - Application description corrected
3. **aicube-config.py** - Configuration settings updated
4. **aicube.env** - Environment variables corrected
5. **aicube-models/aicube-embedding-translator.py** - Model info updated
6. **FINAL-DELIVERY.md** - Delivery documentation corrected

## 🎯 **Current Accurate Technology Stack:**

### **Actually Implemented:**
- ✅ **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework
- ✅ **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework for neural networks
- ✅ **MLP Architecture** - Multi-Layer Perceptron with residual connections
